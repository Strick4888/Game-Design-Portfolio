Whatever progress you had made in this night&apos;s vision is forgotten to you by now, and your illusionary avatar is fading from your mind&apos;s eye. Bright colors flash and flow before your eyes as you sink back to reality. You open your eyes and you can see the carved ceiling of your hut.  You are lying on the ground in the center of the hut, and feel incredibly weak and drowsy. You have awakened far too early from your vision quest, and need to rest before trying to move. 
Lifebound
An Interactive Fiction by Benjamin Strick
Release 1 / Serial number 150422 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Shaman&apos;s Hut (on the Woven Mat)
The hut has no furniture, and your important possessions are placed neatly on the floor.  A fire is crackling and the yearning starlight filters through the smoke chimney in your roof.  Local insects chirp and the sound of a rushing wind can be heard against the fabric of the tent.

You can see a Crackling Fire, an Insidious Artifact, a Bone Effigy, an Essence of the Jungle Toad, a Stone Totem, a Leather Lockbox (closed) and a Lifebind Necklace here.

You slowly snap back to reality, as otherworldy clouds, voices, and colors in your mind&apos;s eye fade.  It is night once again.  You experience a strange feeling of Deja Vu due to waking up from what was the most intense vision quest you have ever experienced.  In fact, you barely remember any of it... you just know it was more powerful than any other you&apos;ve had. Something in your soul feels fundamentally altered.  You feel an odd mix of terror, vengeance, and urgency; suddenly you recall past events with the supposed panther. You look around in panic as you notice your Bone Effigy and Insidious Artifact are missing. You feel an additional spike of confusion as your solar calculations tell you that days have passed since you were last awake.

Jungle Enclave
You can feel the pulse of the jungle&apos;s raw mass of life in your bones.  Somewhere deep in your mind you are aware of the jungle denizen&apos;s hopeless struggle for prolonged existence.  Beasts, insects, and humans combined radiate out a desperate energy from their souls that you have learned to tune out.

Village
Purple flame and smoke ravage the landscape.  A scent of death and soul energy tinges your nose.  You are days too late, and the dark spirit has already used your items to incinerate everyone here. Your heart sinks as you realize what has happened. However, you are shortly assailed by an irrestible surge of victory. Tension built up for years is released as you realize the ties to your past have been cut.

The entire batch is set alight and your hut begins to fill with an overbearing smell that you know all too well.  You reach out to grab the cat, but before you can do anything a wave of ethereal images and voices assails your mind.  Before all goes dark, you feel a pang of fear as you realize just how much Essence you have inhaled... nearly one hundred fold the reccomended amount.

Shaman&apos;s Hut (on the Woven Mat)
The hut has no furniture, and your important possessions are placed neatly on the floor.  A fire is crackling and the yearning starlight filters through the smoke chimney in your roof.  Local insects chirp and the sound of a rushing wind can be heard against the fabric of the tent.

You can see a Crackling Fire, a Stone Totem, a Leather Lockbox (empty) and a Lifebind Necklace here.

You slowly snap back to reality, as otherworldy clouds, voices, and colors in your mind&apos;s eye fade.  It is night once again.  You experience a strange feeling of Deja Vu due to waking up from what was the most intense vision quest you have ever experienced.  In fact, you barely remember any of it... you just know it was more powerful than any other you&apos;ve had. Something in your soul feels fundamentally altered.  You feel an odd mix of terror, vengeance, and urgency; suddenly you recall past events with the supposed panther. You look around in panic as you notice your Bone Effigy and Insidious Artifact are missing. You feel an additional spike of confusion as your solar calculations tell you that days have passed since you were last awake.

Jungle Enclave
You can feel the pulse of the jungle&apos;s raw mass of life in your bones.  Somewhere deep in your mind you are aware of the jungle denizen&apos;s hopeless struggle for prolonged existence.  Beasts, insects, and humans combined radiate out a desperate energy from their souls that you have learned to tune out.

Whatever progress you had made in this night&apos;s vision is forgotten to you by now, and your illusionary avatar is fading from your mind&apos;s eye. Bright colors flash and flow before your eyes as you sink back to reality. You open your eyes and you can see the carved ceiling of your hut.  You are lying on the ground in the center of the hut, and feel incredibly weak and drowsy. You have awakened far too early from your vision quest, and need to rest before trying to move.

It is usually the color of earth, but can also turn black as night when it detects malignant intentions in those whose auras are clearly altered by their attempts to lie or deceive. Right now, your orb is black. 

A wave of confusion washes over you as you witness the abyssal color of your orb.  There must be evil nearby.  As you turn to look at the devious feline, you meet it&apos;s eyes and realize all too late what has happened. It gives you an oddly human look that tells you all you need to know.

Suddenly, you feel sure that this is a dark ancestral spirit inhabiting the body of this unfortunate jungle panther, and that it jealously desires the destruction of those living.  But something about the intruder&apos;s aural energy tells you this dark spirit is not here for your LIFE, but something else...It&apos;s time to make a move.

Although conspiring with it to take vengeance upon those who wronged you in your past seemed appetizing, something within you knew that this malevolent being had to be stopped.

You slowly snap back to reality, as otherworldy clouds, voices, and colors in your mind&apos;s eye fade.  It is night once again.  You experience a strange feeling of Deja Vu due to waking up from what was the most intense vision quest you have ever experienced.  In fact, you barely remember any of it... you just know it was more powerful than any other you&apos;ve had. Something in your soul feels fundamentally altered.  You feel an odd mix of terror, vengeance, and urgency; suddenly you recall past events with the supposed panther. You look around in panic as you notice your Bone Effigy and Insidious Artifact are missing. You feel an additional spike of confusion as your solar calculations tell you that days have passed since you were last awake.

Jungle Enclave
You can feel the pulse of the jungle&apos;s raw mass of life in your bones.  Somewhere deep in your mind you are aware of the jungle denizen&apos;s hopeless struggle for prolonged existence.

A wave of confusion washes over you as you witness the abyssal color of your orb.  There must be evil nearby.  As you turn to look at the devious feline, you meet it&apos;s eyes and realize all too late what has happened. It gives you an oddly human look that tells you all you need to know.

Suddenly, you feel sure that this is a dark ancestral spirit inhabiting the body of this unfortunate jungle panther, and that it jealously desires the destruction of those living.  But something tells you this dark spirit is not here for YOUR life, but something else...

    <result xml:space="preserve">The cat reacts swiftly and swats all of your reminaing Essence of the Jungle Toad into the Crackling Fire.  The entire batch is set alight and your hut begins to fill with an overbearing smell that you know all too well.  You reach out to grab the cat, but before you can do anything a wave of ethereal images and voices assails your mind.  Before all goes dark, you feel a pang of fear as you realize just how much Essence you have inhaled... nearly one hundred fold the reccomended amount.

Shaman&apos;s Hut (on the Woven Mat)
The hut has no furniture, and your important possessions are placed neatly on the floor.  A fire is crackling and the yearning starlight filters through the smoke chimney in your roof.  Local insects chirp and the sound of a rushing wind can be heard against the fabric of the tent.

You can see a Crackling Fire, a Stone Totem, a Leather Lockbox (empty) and a Lifebind Necklace here.

    <result xml:space="preserve">(first getting off the Woven Mat)
You slowly snap back to reality, as otherworldy clouds, voices, and colors in your mind&apos;s eye fade.  It is night once again.  You experience a strange feeling of Deja Vu due to waking up from what was the most intense vision quest you have ever experienced.  In fact, you barely remember any of it... you just know it was more powerful than any other you&apos;ve had. Something in your soul feels fundamentally altered.  You feel an odd mix of terror, vengeance, and urgency; suddenly you recall past events with the supposed panther cub. You look around in panic as you notice your Bone Effigy and Insidious Artifact are missing. You feel an additional spike of confusion as your solar calculations tell you that days have passed since you were last awake.

Jungle Enclave
You can feel the pulse of the jungle&apos;s raw mass of life in your bones.  Somewhere deep in your mind you are aware of the jungle denizen&apos;s hopeless struggle for prolonged existence.  Beasts, insects, and humans combined radiate out a desperate energy from their souls that you have learned to tune out.

Purple flame and smoke ravage the landscape.  A scent of death and soul energy tinges your nose.  Your heart sinks as you realize what has happened, but a small smile appears on your face.
